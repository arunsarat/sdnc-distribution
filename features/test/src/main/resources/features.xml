        Concept:
            This file is a registry of features defined in the projects for use in integration testing.

            The intent is to capture high level (not low level features).  This means a project
            may have features that are not listed here.  That is fine.  Only the stuff you think
            end users would want to install should be indexed here.

            There are two kinds of features defined here:

            odl-integration-compatible-with-all - to list high level features that don't have compatibility
                issues

            odl-integration-all - to list all features available in OpenDaylighthigh level features
                that have compatibility issues with some other features.  This feature includes
                odl-integration-compatible-with-all

        Directions:
            1) Make sure your feature file is running the tests and passing them in master:
                https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Karaf:Hands_On_Guide#Existing_Feature_Files
            2) Add your <repository> to integration/features/index/src/main/resources/features.xml
            3) If and ONLY if your top level feature is compatible with everything, add it to
                odl-integration-compatible-with-all
            4) If and ONLY if your top level feature is incompatible with other things, add it to
                odl-integration-all
            5) Go to the ../pom.xml and
                a)  Add a dependendy for your feature
                b)  DO NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THE BOOTFEATURES.

            Important note: None of the features defined in this file will be in the integration/karaf build by default
                            because that is what we ship, and test features should not by default ship.
                            Please be aware that the features pulled in via features-integration-repo from the projects
                            *will* be.  Its only these aggregating test features that will be missing.
                            If you need to have these test features defined in this file (for example if you are doing
                            integration testing) then:
                            cd integration/distributions/karaf
                            perl -i -pe "s/features-integration-index/features-integration-test/" target/assembly/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg
                            and they will be present and availble
    -->
    <!-- The features-integration-index should be the one and only repository in this file.
        If you think another repository is needed, please add it to integration/features/index/src/main/resource/features.xml
    -->
    <repository>mvn:org.opendaylight.integration/features-integration-index/${project.version}/xml/features</repository>

    <!-- Please use alphabetical order to add a compatible with all features -->
    <feature name='odl-integration-compatible-with-all' version='${project.version}'>
        <feature version='${feature.mdsal.version}'>odl-mdsal-broker</feature>
        <feature version='${feature.mdsal.version}'>odl-netconf-connector-ssh</feature>
    </feature>

    <!-- Please use aphabetical order for non-compatible features -->
    <feature name='odl-integration-all' version='${project.version}'>
        <feature version='${project.version}'>odl-integration-compatible-with-all</feature>
    </feature>

</features>
